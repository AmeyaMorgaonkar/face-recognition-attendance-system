# Face Recognition Attendance System  

An automated attendance system using facial recognition technology to accurately and efficiently record attendance. Developed with Python and OpenCV, it captures faces via a camera, compares them to a registered database, and logs attendance automatically. This contactless solution is ideal for schools, colleges, workplaces, training centers, conferences, and any environment where reliable and convenient attendance tracking is needed.
